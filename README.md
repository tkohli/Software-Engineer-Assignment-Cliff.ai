### Initializing and setup

1. Started by creating a cluster in MongoDB Atlas
2. Trying to connect over MongoDB using python
3. Scrapped the webpages and then stores it in a json file
4. Using Scrapy Mongodb Pipelines uploading data to mongoDB
5. Performing Queries

### Approach and steps

First I installed scrapy and pymongo.
After installing scrapy I was not able to initialize the repository properly. After trying more than 10 times, I got success from using Anaconda environment.
After this I followed the documentation and successfully scraped quotes tot scrap website.
After this I changed the requirements accordingly and followed similar steps for https://www.net-a-porter.com/.

Current issues in the code :
Some values are changed to None.
No sale price available.

Reasons for Delay:

1. Scrapy Installation took time
2. Trying to find other way around but it didn't worked
